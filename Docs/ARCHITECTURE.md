# Architecture

## Project structure

```
Assets/_Project/
  Scenes/
    Bootstrap.unity            M0.1 entry-point scene
    Worlds/
      M02_DioramaPrototype.unity   M0.2 diorama prototype scene
  Scripts/
    Core/         GameBootstrap (target frame rate, entry logging)
    Camera/       CameraInput, DioramaCameraController (see below)
    World/, Characters/, Interaction/, Learning/, Localization/, UI/
                  empty placeholders for future milestones
    Editor/       Editor-only tooling (URP asset bootstrap, shader stripping)
  Materials/      Simple URP/Lit materials, flat colors only
  Settings/       URP pipeline/renderer assets
Tests/EditMode/    Structural smoke tests (scene loads, components present)
```

Each scene is self-contained: opening it and pressing Play should work with
no manual setup.

## Camera architecture (M0.2)

```
CameraRig (GameObject, pans in the XZ plane)
  - CameraInput            reads input, exposes ICameraInputSource
  - DioramaCameraController  consumes ICameraInputSource, moves the rig,
                              dollies the camera child
  Main Camera (child, fixed pitch, offset along a dolly axis)
```

- **`ICameraInputSource`** (`PanDelta`, `ZoomDelta`) is the only thing
  `DioramaCameraController` depends on for input. `CameraInput` implements
  it today using the new Input System's `Mouse` device (left-drag → pan,
  scroll → zoom). A future `TouchCameraInputSource` (one-finger drag →
  `PanDelta`, pinch → `ZoomDelta`) can implement the same interface and
  swap in without touching the controller.
- **Pan** moves the rig's own `Transform` in the XZ plane, clamped to a
  `Rect` (`panBounds`, Inspector-exposed) so the camera can't leave the
  world.
- **Zoom** dollies the child camera along a fixed offset direction derived
  from `cameraAngle` (distance clamped between `minZoomDistance` and
  `maxZoomDistance`), rather than changing field of view — keeps the
  diorama's perspective consistent at any zoom level and can't clip
  through the terrain or fly off into space.
- Both pan and zoom are smoothed with a simple `Lerp` toward a target
  value (`panSmoothing`, `zoomSmoothing`).
- The camera's fixed pitch (`cameraAngle`, default 50°) intentionally has
  no rotation control yet — out of scope for M0.2.

## Input System

`Packages/manifest.json` already includes `com.unity.inputsystem`, and
`ProjectSettings/ProjectSettings.asset` has `activeInputHandler: 1` (Input
System Package only). `Hidden.Runtime.asmdef` references
`Unity.InputSystem` so `CameraInput` can use `UnityEngine.InputSystem`
APIs directly.

## Rendering

URP 17.6.0, one `UniversalRenderPipelineAsset` (`URP-Mobile`, created and
committed from the real Unity Editor — see `M0.1` history for why a
script-generated one was not reliable on device). Materials are flat-color
`Universal Render Pipeline/Lit`, no textures, kept mobile-lightweight.
